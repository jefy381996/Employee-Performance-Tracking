## 🔒 Security Information

### Domain-Bound Licensing
- Your license key is bound to your specific domain
- It will only work on the domain it was created for
- License sharing between different websites is not allowed

### License File Location
```
/wp-content/plugins/student-result-management/license.key
```

### File Permissions
- The license file should be readable by the web server
- Recommended permissions: 644

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### License Not Working?
1. **Check File Name**: Must be exactly `license.key`
2. **Check File Location**: Must be in the plugin root directory
3. **Check File Content**: Should contain only the license key
4. **Check Domain**: License key must match your domain
5. **Clear Cache**: Clear any caching plugins

### Common Issues
- **File Not Found**: Make sure the file is uploaded to the correct location
- **Permission Denied**: Check file permissions (should be 644)
- **Wrong Domain**: License key domain must match your website domain
